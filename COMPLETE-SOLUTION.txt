# COMPLETE SOLUTION FOR ANDROID APK GENERATION

## Status: READY - Just need Java 17

Your React app has been successfully converted to use Capacitor for Android!
All configuration is complete except for installing Java 17.

## QUICK START - Manual Steps:

### Step 1: Install Java 17 (Manual Download)
1. Go to: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17
2. Click "Latest release" for Java 17 LTS
3. Download "OpenJDK 17 (LTS)" → Windows x64 → .zip file
4. Save it as: D:\java17\jdk17.zip
5. Extract the ZIP file in the same folder
6. You should now have: D:\java17\jdk-17.x.x+xx-hotspot\

### Step 2: Run the Automated Build
Double-click on: build-apk.bat

That's it! The script will:
- Detect your Java 17 installation
- Clean previous builds
- Rebuild web assets
- Sync to Android
- Generate the APK file

## Expected Output:
APK will be generated at:
`android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`

## What's Already Done:
✅ Capacitor installed and configured
✅ Android platform added
✅ Web assets built and synced
✅ Gradle configured to use D: drive (saves C: space)
✅ Environment variables set up
✅ All scripts created

## Troubleshooting:
If build fails, check:
1. Java 17 is properly extracted in D:\java17\
2. Path doesn't contain spaces or special characters
3. Antivirus isn't blocking the build process

## Alternative Method (if bat file doesn't work):
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```powershell
cd "D:\Joey Ventulan\Personal Apps\scriptur-quest-pro-main\scriptur-quest-pro-main"
.\build-apk.bat
```

The APK file will be compatible with Android 6.0+ devices.
